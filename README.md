# Vocabulary Master

## *create your original vocabulary book*

A *proposal*:
- What will the application do?
    - This application save **English** **words** and **idioms** which users add. 
    Users can refer the list and enjoy some practice game to reinforce their vocabulary. 
    (option: through attaching tag to each word and idiom, users can group their vocabulary by purpose.)
- Who will use it?
    - Anyone who worry about his or her vocabulary of English such as international students or 
    who want to learn terminologies of specific field like biology.
- Why is this project of interest?
    - As an international student whom English is a second language, I have difficulties to face unknown words and idioms 
    many times when I read or listen to. Additionally, such weak vocabulary affect my variety of speaking and writing words
    So, increasing vocabulary is necessary and significant for my living and academic studying.

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  Note that the IntelliJ markdown previewer doesn't seem to render 
the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
